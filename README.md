# Byebid

Sell and purchase tickets to various events. Have an extra ticket? Sell or auction it off and make a profit. Customers will have the option to buy the ticket at a set price or start a bidding war. The app name is a play on the word “byebug” the debugging tool available on rails, the concept being you can either buy or bid for a ticket.
